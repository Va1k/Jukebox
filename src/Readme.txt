==== Readme ====
This Java applet is a basic 'Jukebox' application that plays music and displays metadata such as album artwork.



=Requirements
- Java 6 or later
- A good web browser such as Firefox
- The applet must be run from a local location, a hard drive or network share. Not a http server.



=Adding Files
Adding new files to the jukebox is easy, simply put .wav formatted files inside the 'Data' directory and start the applet.

The files will appear in the list of songs.

*Optional: Follow the naming convention `TrackName - Artist.wav` in order to automatically format the track name and artist within the applet.

*Optional: Place an image named `wavFileName.jpg' inside the Data\AlbumArt folder to automatically display the image whenever the .wav file it's named after is played.

Warning: Do not delete the default.jpg file inside the Data\AlbumArt folder.



=Using the applet
Start the applet by opening the index.html file in your browser of choice.

Select a file by double-clicking on it in the list at the bottom of the applet.

If there are no files in the list, refer to the 'Adding Files' section of this document.
